Here is the Yolo V3 for object detection.
There are some dependencies to run this program:
    - tensorflow (in my local, I use 1.14.0 version)
    - NumPy
    - Pillow
    - seaborn
    - Open CV
    - Keras

We also need other files:
    - coco.names (for label of coco library)
    - yolov3.cfg (for load the configuration layer per layer of Yolo V3)
    - yolov3.weights (for load pretrained weights of Yolo V3 for coco library)
    - futur (font)
    - image.jpg (the sample image that we used for testing)
